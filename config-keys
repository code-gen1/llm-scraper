Configuration Keys
A configuration key is a string that corresponds to a configuration parameter for the software broker. You can use configuration keys to set configuration parameters for the software event broker when you create a container. You do this bypassing the configuration key and its value to the container runtime at startup (for example, as a parameter to docker create).

For information about using these keys, see Initializing a Software Event Broker Container.

The following table lists the configuration keys for the software event broker.

Configuration Key	Description	Value
bruteforceprotection/enable	
Enables brute force protection. For more information, see Configuring Brute Force Protection.

yes or no

The default value is yes.

configsync/enable	
Enables Config-Sync.

To synchronize the HA pair after the software event brokers are initialized, you must manually assert system-level configuration of one event broker over its mate. For more information, see Asserting Event Broker System Configurations.

yes or no

The default value is no.

configsync/tls/enable	
Enables the use of TLS encryption.

If enabled, and redundancy is also enabled, a pre-shared-key must be configured for config-sync to be operational.

yes or no

The default value is no.

interface/<ip_intf>/physical

Indicates whether to enable the Solace PubSub+ IP interface.

yes or no

The default value is yes.

The default value is file.

Valid values for <log_facility> are debug, command, system, event or kernel.

logging/<log_facility>/format	
The format of a log stream if it is sent to stdout. For more information, see Configuring Container Logging.

logging/<log_facility>/messageformat	
The format of syslog messages emitted from the event broker.

The messageformat key is valid only for the event and system syslog facilities.

The default value is text.

If json is specified, the corresponding value of logging/<log_facility>/format is ignored (the format will always be raw). This is also true if this value is switched later via the CLI.

max-size or days.

The default value is max-size.

logging/retentionpolicymaxnumdays
